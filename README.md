# msync

Simple command-line tool to synchronize mtimes on matching files in different directory trees

If you use [Unison](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
 you may have encountered situations where a program you use updates the mtimes of several thousand files without actually changing the content,
 which means you have to wade through several thousand `props` changes to find a few content changes.
If you would rather keep the oldest mtime of the content than tell Unison to ignore mtimes,
 this tool can help.

msync currently also preserves atimes at the expense of changing ctimes.
The issue is that accessing files to compare them can trigger an update to their atimes, which may be unwanted,
 but restoring the original atimes will trigger an update to their ctimes.
Future releases may provide options to change this behavior.
